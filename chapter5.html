        There were many reasons that contributed to the decline of Feudalism. Political 
        Developments. In England Henry II's legal reforms strengthened English common 
        law and the role of judges and juries. Magna Carta established the idea of rights 
        and liberties that even a monarch cannot violate. It also affirmed that monarchs 
        should rule with the advice of the governed. Edward I's Model Parliament gave a 
        voice in government to common people, as well as to nobles. The Bubonic Plague. 
        The bubonic plague killed about one-third of the people of Europe. After the 
        plague, the need for workers to rebuild Europe led to a slight shift in power 
        from feudal lords to the common people. The Hundred Years' War. This was a 
        series of battles between England and France which caused a rise in national 
        pride and identity in both countries. It strengthened the monarchs and began to 
        reduce the importance of nobles and knights on the battlefield.
