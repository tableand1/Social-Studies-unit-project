        Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire.â€‚In 330 C.E., the Roman emperor Constantine
        moved his capital to Byzantium, later called Constantinople. After the fall of 
        Rome, the eastern half of the empire continued on there. Today, it is referred to
        as the Byzantine Empire. One of the greatest Byzantine emperors was Justinian I. 
        He rebuilt Constantinople after it was destroyed by rioting in 532 and worked to 
        reclaim some of Rome's lost territory. His most lasting contribution is probably the 
        Justinian Code, which became the basis for many other, later legal codes in the 
        western world. The Byzantine Empire was a Christian state. The Eastern Orthodox Church
        was at the center of daily life and inspired magnificent art and architecture. 
        Byzantine emperors and patriarchs in Constantinople clashed with popes in Rome over 
        a number of issues. These disagreements led to conflict between the Roman Catholic 
        Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church in 1054.
