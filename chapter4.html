        During the high middle ages, towns started developing. One reason is that 
        the improvement of agriculture. People had a surplus of food that they needed 
        to sell at town markets. To become free of your master/noble, you would have to get a Royal
        Charter. To get a Royal Charter, you would either have to pay a certain amount of 
        money or work for a long time. Later, towns becamse a place where people would not only
        sell things, they would also make them. Guilds were organizations of people who 
        did a certain craft or trade. The Guilds provided help and protections for a 
        certain group of people. They maintained a high standard. To become part of a guild, 
        it was hard and difficult. You would start around the age 12, and become an apprentice,
        then you would present to your master a masterpiece at around 19, and your master would
        decide if you were worthy to become a master. Near the beginning of the Middle Ages,
        most trade was luxury items. As more trade happened, more everyday items started being 
        traded. Lots of people prosered, but there was one group of people who didnt, the Jews.
        The Jews had lots of prejeduce against them. It was hard to earn a living and 
        lords and nobles could take the Jews land or money at will. One opportunity for Jews 
        was becoming a banker or moneylender because the Christian Religion believed 
        that being a banker was a bad job. Medieval towns were small and crowded. Houses 
        were built of wood and had around 4 floors. Most families worked where they lived,
        but the rich families had different floors for different things like eating, working
        and living. Half the children died before they became adults. Unsanitary conditions 
        led to the spread of disease. Most garbage was tossed into rivers. There were not many
        cures for dieases back in that time. To answer the question, what was life back in 
        medieval towns? Life was hard. Around half of the children died before adulthood. 
        You would become an adult by the age of 12. It was not clean and disease was a very big 
        threat. You would live with multiple families in the same house. If you were a Jew, it 
        would be harder to find a job just because of your culture. Lords and Nobles to take your, 
        money and land. We do not believe life was very good in medieval towns, however, 
        it was better than being a serf because you would at least have your own freedom.
        To conclude, we believe that life in medieval towns was hard and difficult.
