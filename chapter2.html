        When Rome fell the early middle ages began. When the empire collapsed life
        was dangerous and difficult, and it was hard to find food. One powerful group was the
        Franks. One of their biggest leaders was Charlamegne. Charlamegne built his empire 
        with the help of Pope Leo III. He was crowned the holy emperor of Rome which helped 
        both the church and Charlamegne. Muslims and the Vikings kept on raiding the villages. 
        To protect themselves,western Europe created a system called Feudalism. Feudalism provided 
        people protection.The way it worked is that all the land belonged to the monarch. He gave fiefs/land grants
        to his most important lords. In exchange, the lords would give knights to the monarch
        in times of war. The lords would also give land to the knights, to give protection.
        The peasants would work the land for the knights and lords in exchange for land. It was
        a system of checks and balances. Feudalism provided safety and stability to much of Europe.
        To answer the question,how well did feudalism establish order in Europe in the middle
        ages. We believe it established order well because Europe was in chaos, it offered stability
        and protection to the people. It was needed at that time and it was a good government system.
        It might sound not too fair to us because we have democracy, but back in that time 
        it was a very effiecent system of government.
