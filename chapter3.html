        The Christian religion is the most followed religion in the world. Before, Romans 
        persecuted Christians for their beliefs. However in 313 C.E. Roman emporor Constantine
        allowed Christians to practice their religion freely. In 393 C.E. the Christian
        religion became the official religion in Rome. In the begining of the middle ages
        all Christians in the middle ages belonged to the Roman Catholic Church. The church
        provided leadership and sometimes distributed food. The church leaders made an 
        organization called the clergy. At the top was the pope, then came the cardinals, 
        then the archbishops, then the bishops, and last came the priests. During the
        middle ages the church acquired great economic power and became the largest land holder 
        in Europe. Each person was expected to give 10% of his money to support the church 
        as tax. Church officials were often the only people who could read. Most people
        believed in god and the afterlife. Most Christains wished to go on a pilgrimage.
        Going on a pilgrimage was very difficult as travel was very dangerous and difficult.
        Another type of service was fighting in the Crusades, the Crusades were a series
        of military expediations to recover holy sites like Jerusalem. During the middle ages,
        art was mostly used for religous purposes. Painting of saints and Jesus were used to
        help people worship. During the Middle Ages most schooling took place in Churches and
        Monasteries. Most people who learned to read and write were children of nobles and
        were going to be part of the Clergy when they grew up. To answer the question,
        how influencial was the Roman Catholic Church, we believe it was very influential because
        of many reasons. Most of the time, only clergy could read and write, which is why they 
        had lots of influence over the king because they were the ones that kept records. They
        were the largest land owner of medieval times and had lots of power. The Pope got to decide 
        who was the holy king which gave the king religous power as well as military power. Most people
        believed in the afterlife, and the Church was the gateway to it. These are the reasons why
        we believe that the Roman Catholic Church was very influential.
